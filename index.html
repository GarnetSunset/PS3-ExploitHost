<body text="white" style="background-color:#2b2b2b;">Below are two webkit based exploits for the PS3, these will allow you to flash CFW after running these two exploits.
    <br> First step to identifying which of the two links you want is to identify which PS3 you have!
    <br>
    <a href="http://gyazo.com/98334232c96ee35dc4f93f11adb31996.png">Click here to identify which model you have.</a>
    <br> When looking at the back of the PHAT PS3, does it say "Axx/Bxx/Cxx/Exx/Gxx"? if so, you have a Nand PS3!
    <br> If you have anything else on a PHAT PS3, you have a NOR PS3! If you have a slim (20xx ONLY!!!) PS3 you have a NOR PS3!
    <br>
    <br> Make sure that you have the file on my site linked
    <br>
    <a href="https://github.com/GarnetSunset/PS3-ExploitHost/blob/master/PutOnUsb4.82/flsh.hex?raw=true">here</a>, at the root of your USB Drive in the slot closest to your Blu Ray drive on the front!
    <br>
    <br> Make sure your browser has no other tabs open! Don't want to screw up memory.
    <br>
    <br> Ready to go? Good luck!!
    <br>
    <br> Click on the button and wait for PS3 to power down. DO NOT STOP THE PROCESS ONCE STARTED!!
    <br> Once PS3 has powered down, reboot console and install CFW matching OFW version. If installing through XMB does not work, boot to recovery and install.
    <br>
    <br> Here's a link to a 4.82 CFW. <a href="http://www.psx-place.com/threads/4-82-ferrox-cobra-7-53-custom-firmware-v1-00.15%20453/">Here's what I use.</a>

        Click this for NOR:
